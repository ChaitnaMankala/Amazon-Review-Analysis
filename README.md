# Amazon Review Analysis
Conducted an in-depth sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for both utilitarian and hedonic products, comparing key themes, sentiments, and word usage between these categories.
Developed a data pipeline using Python to scrape and preprocess Amazon reviews, leveraging BeautifulSoup for web scraping and applying data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Created and analyzed word clouds, bigrams, and trigrams to identify common words, product-related features, and frequent topics discussed in reviews for utilitarian and hedonic products.
Implemented sentiment analysis using the AFINN and NRC lexicons, visualizing distributions and trends of emotions like joy, trust, anger, and anticipation for products.
Utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling and extracted prominent topics for both product categories, gaining insights into product features and user experiences.
Visualized results using ggplot2 and presented findings with clear narratives to demonstrate differences in customer satisfaction and product perception.
Compared variances in star ratings between the utilitarian (iRobot) and hedonic (New York Biology Mud Mask) products to assess the diversity in customer experiences.
